BGU Fitness Studio Management System
This is a C++ program that simulates the management of a fitness studio. It allows opening the studio, assigning customers with different workout strategies to trainers, creating workout plans based on those strategies, calculating trainer salaries, and performing various other actions like moving customers between trainers, printing reports, and backing up/restoring the studio state.
The program reads configuration data from an input file, including the number of trainers, their capacities, and the available workout options. It then enters an interactive loop where the user can enter different action commands to manage the studio operations.
The program is implemented using an object-oriented design with classes for the studio, trainers, customers, workouts, and actions. It handles memory management correctly and avoids leaks. The code must be compiled and run on a Unix systems.
